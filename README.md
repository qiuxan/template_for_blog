template_for_blog
=================
This template is developed by Xian Qiu based on the the designing work provided by Chris Johnson. It is a template for personal blog.

To use this template, the developer should firstly change the user information in the index.php file. Also, the profile image can be changed. Just find the image file and change it.

If the user hopes to create sub-pages and keep the consistency, just copy the index.php and page_content.php to a new folder and change the $rootPath value in index.php into the correct one. For example, if the user creates a folder and name it 'example' in the rootPath and the path of the folder 'example' is 'rootPath/example', the correct value for $rootPath is '../' instead of the original value './'.

Hope this one can help someone. Good luck for your project and thanks for reading:)
